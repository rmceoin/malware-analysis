Several weeks ago I had a request for an RSS feed for the posts I do here.
I thought that's a great idea, but eventually realized that I
had not been using the posts functionality offered by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Took some digging through the Github Pages documentation, learning more Jekyll,
switching to the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) Theme,
and voil√†! posts functionality is here along with the benefit of RSS.
